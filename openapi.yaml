        Upload Timescale Nominations for Participant as a "Schedule Document", read more at: https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/EDI/Library/cim_based/schema/Schedule%20document%20uml%20model%20and%20schema%20v1.1.pdf

        First you need to upload the "Schedule Document" XML as a standard Attachment using the `uploadAttachment` endpoint, then you need to submit the returned ID of the Attachment to this endpoint, which validates file syntax and contents before accepting it.
